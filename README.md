### ‚ú®&nbsp; About Me

Hello again, I'm Safak. I've been working with Artonomi since 2011. I'm a developer. I develop web, mobile, and sometimes robotic system software.

This module is designed to create simple discounts for use on e-commerce websites based on the Prestashop platform, based on a specific need.

üìï &nbsp;**What does this module do?**

- üî≠ &nbsp;Checks the number of items in the cart :wink:
- üè∑Ô∏è &nbsp;If the number of products in the cart is 3 or more, it applies a discount to the cart at the cheapest product price.
- üí¨ &nbsp;Compatible with AJAX cart updates
- üë®‚Äçüíª &nbsp;It works seamlessly with Prestashop original theme and many themes. But some themes need to be edited. I am working for this.
- ‚ö° &nbsp;Easy to install and configure.
